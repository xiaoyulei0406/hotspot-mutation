# Hotspot-mutation

## Introduction
Identification of hotspot mutations and corresponding wild type and mutated peptides. Somatic mutation data was downloaded from https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/1c8cfe5f-e52d-41ba-94da-f15ea1337efc. It includes 33 cancer types in 10,437 patients. Below is the summary for number of patients in each cancer type.
